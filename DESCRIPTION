Description: Draw images easily and as if doing that was considered desirable or  
 even essential to be able to do. Set up 
 a plot with an image, specify where that image should be placed. Image plot by default
 reflects the index of the image data itself, or can be specified in simple extent terms 
 'xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax'. Numeric matrices, integer arrays, byte arrays, character arrays, and
 native rasters are (or will be) supported. A little bit like 'image()' and 'rasterImage()' from
 the 'graphics' package but with the good features celebrated and made easier to use.
